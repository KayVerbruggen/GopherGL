# GopherGL
This is a package supposed to make easier to use OpenGL in Go. All of the complex stuff is going to be stripped away. I guess it'll end up more as a framework rather than an abstraction of OpenGL. It probably won't be getting a level editor though.

DO NOT USE THIS IN ANY SERIOUS PROJECT, IT'S GARBAGE RIGHT NOW.
